          <h3>Dakshineswar Kali Temple, Kolkata</h3>
          <p>Dakshineswar Kali Temple is a Hindu navaratna temple located at Dakshineswar, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.
            Situated on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, the presiding deity of the temple is Bhavatarini, a form
            of Parashakti Adya Kali, otherwise known as Adishakti Kalika. The temple was built in 1855 by Rani Rashmoni,
            a Zamindar, philanthropist and a devotee of Kali. The temple is known for its association with Ramakrishna
            and Ma Sarada Devi, mystics of 19th Century Bengal.

            The main temple was inspired by Navaratna style Radhakanta temple, built by Ramnath Mondal of Tollygunge.
            The temple compound, apart from the nine-spired main temple, contains a large courtyard surrounding the
            temple, with rooms along the boundary walls. There are twelve shrines dedicated to Shiva—Kali's
            consort—along the riverfront, a temple to Radha-Krishna, a bathing ghat on the river, a shrine dedicated to
            Rani Rashmoni. 'Nahabat', the chamber in the northwestern corner just beyond the last of the Shiva temples,
            is where Ramakrishna and Maa Sarada spent a considerable part of their lives.
            Timings: 8.30 am to 5.30 pm

          <h4 class="info-title">History</h4>
          <p>
            The Dakshineswar Kali Temple was founded around the middle of the 19th century by Rani Rashmoni. Rani
            Rashmoni was a Mahishya by caste and was well known for her philanthropic activities. In the year 1847,
            Rashmoni prepared to go upon a long pilgrimage to the sacred Hindu city of Kashi to express her devotions to
            the Divine Mother. Rani was to travel in twenty-four boats, carrying relatives, servants, and supplies.
            According to traditional accounts, the night before the pilgrimage began, Rashmoni had a vision of the
            Divine Mother goddess Kali in a dream and reportedly said,

            There is no need to go to Banaras. Install my statue in a beautiful temple on the banks of the Ganges river
            and arrange for my worship there. Then I shall manifest myself in the image and accept worship at that
            place.

            Profoundly affected by the dream, Rani immediately looked for and purchased a 30,000-acre plot in the
            village of Dakhineswar. The large temple complex was built between 1847 and 1855. The 20-acre (81,000
            m<sup>2</sup>) plot was bought from an Englishman, Jake Hastie, and was then popularly known as Saheban
            Bagicha. Partly old Muslim burial ground shaped like a tortoise, considered befitting for the worship of
            Shakti according to Tantra traditions, it took eight years and nine hundred thousand rupees to complete the
            construction. The idol of Goddess Kali was installed on the Snana Yatra day on 31 May 1855 amid festivities
            at the temple formerly known as Sri Sri Jagadishwari Kali, with Ramkumar Chhattopadhyay as the head priest.
            Soon his younger brother Gadai or Gadadhar (later known as Ramakrishna) moved in and so did his nephew
            Hriday to assist him. On 31 May 1855 more than 1 lakh (one hundred thousand) Brahmins were invited from
            different parts of the country to grace the auspicious occasion. The next year, Ramkumar Chattopadhyay died,
            and the position was given to Ramakrishna along with his wife Sarada Devi, who stayed in the south side of
            the Nahabat (music room) in a small room on the ground floor, which is now a shrine dedicated to
            her.Ramakrishnana was responsible for bringing much in the way of both fame and pilgrims to the temple.

            Rani Rashmoni lived for only five years and nine months after the inauguration of the temple. She fell
            seriously ill in 1861. Realizing that her death was near, she decided to hand over the property she had
            purchased in Dinajpur (now in Bangladesh) as a legacy for the maintenance of the temple to the temple trust.
            She accomplished her task on 18 February 1861 and died on the next day. After her death, her sons-in-law
            took to celebrating Durga Puja in their respective premises.
